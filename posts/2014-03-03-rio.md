# Rio - Radio Without Ads [![](/images/github-logo_32.png)][rio]

I hate radio ads. I *hate* them. They are just totally unacceptable. It's as
much the radio stations fault as it is the advertiser, but I just can't do it.
You're listening to Sade, then Marvin Gaye, then suddenly laser noises cut in
and some guy shouts at the top of his lungs about car insurance. Honestly, I
don't understand how anyone can handle it.

Being programmers, though, we do not have to settle for this! Enter
`rio`. [Rio][rio] is a server that rebroadcasts radio streams and switches away
from a stream if commercials are detected.

It's currently a very simplistic design that relies on the Shoutcast protocol,
but I've been using it for months now and declare it a smashing success.

## Shoutcast

Before I explain how it works, some background is needed.

In the 90's, Nullsoft needed a way to include metadata in MP3 streams for
online radio for WinAmp (remember that?). MP3 files in general already had
support for this via tags such as ID3, but this didn't help with streaming
because there weren't multiple "files" being played. A listener typically
streamed a single, long blob of MP3 data with many songs in it. So can one get
metadata to the listener without forcing them to reload the stream for every
new song?

Nullsoft's answer was to inject the metadata straight into the binary MP3
stream. The MP3 data isn't altered at all and is still valid, but *additional*
data is injected into it at regular intervals. This data then contains the
various metadata fields that should be displayed to the user in an ugly, badly
encoded format that was typical of the era. The catch is that your client must
be aware of this extra data or your audio will sound corrupt as it tries to
"play" the song description text. In practice, this isn't really an issue
because most servers only produce `ICYINFO` enhanced streams if you request the
stream with a specific header, which only compatible clients will do. The
server responds with the stream, but also its own headers indicating the number
of bytes of real data between each metadata payload.

## Finding Ads

What Rio does is as simple as possible. Check the `ICYINFO` for a commercial
and if so, jump to a new stream. That sounds easy, but there are actually a few
interesting tricks to get right for it to work.

First of all, obviously it only works on stations that include some kind of
recognizable text in the commercial data. This typically says something
annoying like, "GEICO - SUPER THE BEST!!!!," but if you're lucky, it will be
standardized. At least one family of radio streams I listen to actually
*prefixes* every advertisement description with `"AD - "`, which is just too
good to be true.

Second, and much more subtle, is the handling of that response from the
server I was mentioning. So the server, in its response to the client,
includes a header that tells how frequently it will send metadata. Since it's
part of the headers, it can only be passed once and never updated. However,
it's also not standardized, so any station can use whatever value they like
there, depending on how much overhead they want and how much delay they can
tolerate between the start of the new song and the updating of the artist and
track display in the media player. This requires extra care because means that
when Rio switches stations, it might start getting data with a different
metadata interval. If we just forward this on to the client directly, they
could be out of sync and start hearing scratches and blips in the audio. For
example, if you were listening to a stream that had metadata every 1024 bytes,
and now you're listening to one that has metadata every 4096 bytes, you will
quickly drift out of phase and start hearing garbage.

The solution is to have Rio extract the metadata and reconstruct the pure MP3
data itself then re-inject the metadata back into the MP3 stream at its own
fixed rate. Conceptually this isn't very difficult, but it did take some time
to get right. If any bytes get lost or added a long the way, the results are
pretty miserable.

Once the system was fundamentally working, it was easy to extend with some
useful new features. For example, it quickly became a pain to continually
update the catalog of all the recognized ads, but if we consider that no
reasonable song will be under 1.5 to 2 minutes, we can *learn* which titles are
associated with ads by just tracking a song's playing time. This turned out to
be so successful that I didn't even bother with all of the other neat ideas I
had. You always hear an ad the first time around, but if it's short enough, we
simply save that ad's title and add it to our blacklist. Every Friday I go
through the list and make sure to clear out any erroneously labeled ads,
although there are typically very few. Since the pain of hearing an ad is so
much higher than that of missing a song, I'm ok with the sensitivity.
