# ~~Metrorappidd~~ Instabus web App [![](/images/github-logo_32.png)][github]

So we gave up trying fix Google Map auth in the native [Android incarnation of
MetroRappid][droidapp]. We also weren't super thrilled about having to update
the original iOS version.

Instead, we threw them both in the garbage and made a web app. 

## Behold, [Instabus][webapp]!
####Cloud-scale for distributed web 2.0!

[![Its got what busses need. It's got electrolytes!][img_metrorappid small]][img_metrorappid]


It doesn't require any installation, behaves nicely on desktops, tablets, and
phones, and works the same way as before.

Go use it at [instabus.org][webapp].

Or even better, [contribute][github].
