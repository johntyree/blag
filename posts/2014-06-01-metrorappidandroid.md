I participated in the [ATX Hack for Change][hfc] hackathon this weekend as part
of a great team, known in more educated circles as the HackStreetBoyz (my
initials *are* JT, you know.) We threw together an Android app for using
Austin's MetroRapid bus and rail system.

## The App

The MetroRappid app is essentially a single screen map view that intelligently
chooses an appropriate bus stop to display information for based on your
current location.

#### It works like this:

  1. Open the app
  2. Walk towards the blue dot before time runs out and you miss your bus

![This is the first and only screen.][img_map]

In the end we built a workable app that I think we're all pretty happy with.
It's *way* faster and easier to use than the official CapMetro app, and only
crashes when you're trying to show it to someone, so that's something.

Here's the presentation we showed Sunday evening.
