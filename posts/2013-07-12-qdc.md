# Quick and Dirty C/C++ [![](/images/github-logo_32.png)][repo]

I am tired of C. I am tired of C++. I am tired of sacrificing goats to the gods
of Google and Stack Overflow every time I have something *trivial* that needs
to be embedded in my application. Enter,
[Quick-and-Dirty-C](https://github.com/johntyree/QDC). It's a
[growing](2013-01-30-cuda-gcc-47.html) collection of tricks, tweaks, and handy
functions for doing the kinds of trivial things that everyone expects will take
5 minutes to write, but in fact require many hours to write and many days to
get right. In this post I'll introduce the most recent addition, a small
collection of functions for filtering a buffer of data through another program
via `stdin` and `stdout`. So if you weren't planning on using strlen() for some
reason, you might filter your string through `wc -c`, doing the equivalent of
this:

    $ echo "Hello, Monde!" | wc -c.

As it turns out, this is [*far* from trivial][backtrace] to get working correctly.
