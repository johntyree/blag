So this weekend was the [ATX Hack for Change][hfc] civic hackathon at St.
Edwards University in Austin. ~36 hours of pizza, granola bars, energy drinks
and trying to figure out the Google Maps API v2 from Saturday morning at 0900
to Sunday evening at 1700, followed by short project presentations and a Q&A
session. I [talked about our app elsewhere][m4a post], so I'd like to focus on
the hackathon itself here.

If you've never done one before, I encourage you to *get out there and do one.*
Austin is particularly active in this arena, but
[with a little investigation](http://www.hackathon.io/) you can probably dig
something up. If all else fails, start your own!

There were something like 100 people split into 16 teams at ATX Hack for
Change, spanning a pretty wide array of goals; although many were along the
lines of "Make a web mashup of some data that's hard to use right now." On our
five man team, only two had experience making Android applications of any kind.
Of the other three, only one had made an iOS app before and none of us had
never really written any Java at all. Still, it was fun. I learned a lot in a
short time and by Saturday evening I was making reasonable contributions to the
code base.

I can't stress enough how *great* the atmosphere was. It was really motivating
to be around 100 other people all scrambling to get an MVP thrown together by
the end of the weekend. There were plenty of great snacks and drinks, meals
were provided, and we could walk around the Campus during the day for short
breaks.

The presentations were pretty high intensity as everyone tried to cram a whole
weekend of work into a 3 minute presentation, but we finished our app with
enough spare time on Sunday afternoon to put together what I feel was a [pretty
good one][presentation]. Apparently the audience agreed because we were voted
best project/team! In addition to delicious bragging rights, we all get free
tickets to [SXSW Interactive][sxsw]. I missed the festival entirely this year
so I'm really looking forward to it.
