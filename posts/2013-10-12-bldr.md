# bldr - A simple source-embedded scripting tool


[`bldr`][bldr] is a very simple builder for sharing examples. Think Makefiles, but as
part of your actual source code and without all the features.

`bldr` searches your file for lines containing an optional comment delimiter and
the magic string "`bldr: <command>`."
It then runs the commands in order from top to bottom. Everything after
"`bldr:`" is the command. Everything else in the file is ignored.

It supports a few magical Vim variables to smartly find and manipulate the file
path and name. Currently this is just `%` with the modifiers `:p` and `:r`.

From Vim's help (`:help expand`):

```scheme
%		current file name
Modifiers:
        :p		expand to full path
        :h		head (last path component removed)
        :t		tail (last path component only)
        :r		root (one extension removed)
        :e		extension only
```


Consider this example file written in C.
```c
// bldr: gcc -lm -o %:r %
// bldr: %:r
// bldr: rm %:r

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <assert.h>

int main() {
    printf("SUCCESS %f\n", sin(M_PI_4));
    return 0;
}
```

You can run `bldr <filename>` on that and it will compile it and run it for you
automatically!

You may think to yourself, "Hey. This is just shell scripting, minus all the
features." You're right. That's it.

It is useful though! Check it out on [GitHub][bldr].
