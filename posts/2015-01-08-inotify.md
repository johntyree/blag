# inotify-tools runs my life

In any good discussion about programming tools the topic of IDEs will always
come up. It has never, in the history of all mankind, not come up. You may have
heard some neckbeard on Reddit or IRC repeat the mantra that they use Linux or
Unix and "\*nix is IDE."

This post is just that. Personally, I'm a Vim user. I have an
[impressive][dotfiles] collection of plugins to make it do the things I need,
but it is still not an IDE. It turns out, however, that we can do one better!

If your Linux kernel has been configured with `CONFIG_INOTIFY` you can tell the
kernel to watch the filesystem for changes. These changes can be of many
different kinds but we're interested in just a few - closing a file and moving a
file.

The real magic comes from the `inotifywait` client from the `inotify-tools`
package. When you call it, it blocks until one of these specified events
happens. Then it returns. The end. We can use this in a bash function to run
arbitrary commands when ever files change.

Here is my magic incantation. First define a wrapper function in your
`~/.bashrc` file. I probably use this function about 70% of the time I'm coding
anything.
```bash
onmodify ()
{
    TARGET=${1:-.};
    shift;
    CMD="$@";
    echo "$TARGET" "$CMD";
    (
    while inotifywait --exclude '.git' -qq -r -e close_write,moved_to,move_self $TARGET; do
        sleep 0.2;
        bash -c "$CMD";
        echo;
    done )
}
```

Then you can use it with
```bash
$ onmodify . "nosetests --rednose --failed --with-id"
```
and it will run your tests every time you modify a file! Works at any time,
with any file or language. Amazing. Long live the Linux, the best IDE!
