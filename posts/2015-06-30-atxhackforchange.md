Wow. It's already been a year and the [ATX Hack for Change][hfc] civic
hackathon at St. Edwards University has come and gone again. This year was
really well done again and really shows how much the spirit of civic duty and
philanthropy shines through here in Austin.

One major feature of this year's hackathon was the involvement of the city
government itself. The mayor gave a great speech about the difficulties that
Austin faces in the near and far future, and how events like ATX Hack for
Change provide an excellent way for the citizens (that's us) to help steer the
development of the city when local government can't or won't take action. There
were several other city employees there from various offices that need
technological help solving their problems. It was really nice to get to meet
these folks as well as to see just why it is that the city government is so
slow to get anything done. When the only person with the password to the
database of land deeds gets brain cancer and forgets it (*yes, seriously*),
it's obviously going to take some time to recover that data.

I'd also like to applaud the city's major advancements on the data front. Since
our somewhat cheeky app last year to scrape real-time bus data from CapMetro's
undocumented API, the city has not only made the API public, but has added real
time information feeds for *all* the buses. It's a big step forward and our app
[Instabus][instabus] (n√©e metrorappid) is already making use of it.

Apparently last year's prize of free SXSW tickets was a one-time thing. There
were no prizes this year at all, which I think is fine. I appreciated our
tickets and SXSW was really great, but I think awarding a "first place" prize
at a civic hackathon is really missing the point.

Can't wait until next year!
